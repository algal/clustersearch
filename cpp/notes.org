* todo

** move PRINT support into other file
** setup logging macro or boost logging
** switch to int-based datatype for genos
** implement func for doing runs and calculating stats
** 



* notes on performance

** Python outperforming CPP.

   unclear why.

   CPP mut() function faster than python mut() function

   Python search() faster than cpp() search.

***   tried switching mut() to return list<geno> instead of set<geno>.

      broke set_difference

***   tried extracting a key collection insted of using transform_iterator.

      same correct result. killed performance.

*** profiling suggests that cpp version may be spending a lot of time creating/destroying strings.

*** maybe b/c cpp map is a tree, and python map is a hashtable?
